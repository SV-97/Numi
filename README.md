# Numi

Implementation of a concatenative / stack oriented language (like Factor) in various languages.

Implementations labeled with "level1" don't have frames.
Frames are essentially Smalltalk _blocks_ or factor _quotations_.

Currently implemented:

- Rust (Full)
- Haskell (Full)
- Python (Level1)
- C (Level1)
